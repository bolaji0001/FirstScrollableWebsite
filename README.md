# My Scrollable Website

A single-page website featuring smooth scroll navigation and dynamic link highlighting. This project demonstrates JavaScript scroll functionality, CSS design skills, and interactive user experience elements.

## Overview

This project showcases a scrollable single-page website where JavaScript handles smooth scrolling to different sections when navigation links are clicked. The website highlights the current section's link in the navbar as users scroll, creating an intuitive navigation experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation**: JavaScript enables smooth transitions to sections when clicking navbar links
- **Active Link Highlighting**: The navigation link for the current section is automatically highlighted as users scroll through the page
- **Button Hover Transitions**: Buttons feature smooth color and style transitions when hovered over
- **Image Scaling on Hover**: Images scale up smoothly when users hover over them
- **Section-based Navigation**: Each navbar link connects to its corresponding section using href and id attributes

## Technologies Used

## What I Learned

Building this project helped me understand several important web development concepts:

- **Scroll Navigation**: Learned how to connect navbar links to page sections by matching the `href` attribute of links with the `id` attribute of sections. This was a fundamental concept for creating single-page navigation
- **Box-shadow Inset**: Discovered how to use `box-shadow: inset` to create borders around elements without adding extra height or width to the element. This technique helps maintain consistent layout dimensions while adding visual borders
- **Dynamic Link Highlighting**: Gained experience with JavaScript event listeners to detect scroll position and update the active navigation link accordingly
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Understood how to implement smooth scroll behavior for better user experience

## Getting Started

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view it locally. No build process or dependencies are required.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive JavaScript features
- Enhance the scroll detection for better performance
- Implement additional animations
- Add more sections and content
- Improve mobile navigation experience
